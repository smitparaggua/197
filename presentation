About the Data

Methodology

    Cramer's V for computing level of association
    based on: http://groups.chass.utoronto.ca/pol242/Labs/LM-3A/LM-3A_content.htm
    LEVEL OF ASSOCIATION    Verbal Description        COMMENTS
    0.00                    No Relationship           Knowing the independent variable does not help in predicting the dependent variable.
    .00 to .15              Very Weak                 Not generally acceptable
    .15 to .20              Weak                      Minimally acceptable
    .20 to .25              Moderate                  Acceptable
    .25 to .30              Moderately Strong         Desirable
    .30 to .35              Strong                    Very Desirable
    .35 to .40              Very Strong               Extremely Desirable
    .40 to .50              Worrisomely Strong        Either an extremely good relationship or the two variables are measuring the same concept
    .50 to .99              Redundant                 The two variables are probably measuring the same concept.
    1.00                    Perfect Relationship.     If we the know the independent variable, we can perfectly predict the dependent variable.
